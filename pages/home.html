        <h1>Hoang Dang</h1>
        <p>Currently a senior at Gannon University, I am on track to complete my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science by May 2025. 
        My role as a Cloud Computing Researcher and a Virtual Reality App Developer has allowed me to dive deep into cutting-edge 
        technologies including AWS and C#. In collaboration with esteemed faculty, our team has made significant strides in optimizing 
        data center operations and developing immersive VR applications for industrial engineering.</p>
        
        <p>The work we have done, particularly in rendering hydraulic pistons interactable and setting up virtual reality environments, 
        was showcased at a recent conference, underscoring our commitment to innovation and practical application. I thrive in 
        environments that value teamwork and communication, and I am eager to leverage my skills to contribute to an organization that 
        champions these principles. My journey at Gannon University has equipped me with a unique perspective, blending academic rigor 
        with hands-on experience, ready to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
