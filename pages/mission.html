        <h1>My mission</h1>
        <p>Growing up, I really struggle with depression, and I often found myself questioning the reasons behind it.
            I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, ADHD and major depression, and was prescribed with anti-depressants.
            Each day felt like a challenge, and I sometimes wondered if my life should have come to an end.

           My mission is to help others that are in the same boat like me, who struggle to find purpose in life.
           I never want someone to be alone like I did. I used to hide everything because if I showed any emotions,
           my parents would deemed me as a weak person.
        </p>

           I love playing basketball and volunteering. One is the purest form of art, and one is the purest form of love.
        </p>

           I want to become a neuroscientist one day, to help others like me, for free. I will never charge a penny.
